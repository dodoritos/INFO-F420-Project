    <h1>Self-Approaching Paths in Simple Polygons</h1>
    <h2>Romain Mardulyn, Dorian Hoet</h2>
    <p>A self approaching path between two points is a curve such that when you move along the curve the distance
    to any further point does not increase.</p>

    <h2>Important concepts</h2>
    <h3>Involute</h3>
    <p>An involute is a curve that depends on another curve. It's traced by unwrapping a string around the original curve</p>
    <p>For the Self-approaching path algorithm, we will only use involutes of circles, here you can see an example of such a curve</p>
    <p>You can slide to see the step of execution, or click on the canva to change the size and orientation of the circle.
      The involute is in red and the unwrapping string is in purple.</p>

    <div id="involute_equation"></div>
    <script src="involute_equation.js"></script>

    <p>An involute is self aproaching.
      Indeed, the distance between the center of the circle and a point 'a' on the circle itself is fixed
      and the ditance between the involute curve and the tengent point is self aproaching,
      so the distance between the center and any point on the involute is always reducing.

    <h4>An equivalent definition of a self-approaching path is that for every point on the path
      there has to be a 90째 angle containing the rest of the path.</h4>

    <h3>Involute curves of kth order </h3>
    <p>
      As said before, an involute is a curve defined by another curve. This other curve can be a circle,
      or an involute of a circle, which gives us an involute of an involute of a circle. An involute of second order.
    </p>

    <p>
      The involute of first order is in purple, and the involute of second order
      (involute of the involute of the circle) is in red
    </p>

    <h3>Geodesic</h3>
    <p>
      A geodesic is the shortest path composed of segments between two points in a polygon
    </p>
    <p>
      You can click on the canva to add points, then close the polygon and add two points inside it.
      The geodesic will be displayed
    </p>

    <h3>Given two points inside a simple polygon, does there exist a self-approaching path inside it?</h3>

    <h2>Self-approaching path</h2>
    <h3>Initialisation</h3>
    <p>
      To construct the shortest self-approaching path in a simple polygone from a point s to a point t, we first need to construct the geodesic between s and t and to split the polygone into 2 chains, the left one and the right one.
      <!--Possible description of how geodesic-->
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to split the polygone, we need to cut it at two points. Those point will be the intersections between the polygone and the 2 half-line we get by prolonging the two extremitys of the geodesic beyond s and t.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will construct the shortest self-aproaching path from the end, by following the geodesic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first part that we will add to the self-approaching path is always the last segment of the geodesic.
    </p>
    <h3>Main loop</h3>
    <p>
      We repeat the followings until we reach S or that we find that there are no self approching path between s and t.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we compute the CH convex hull of the part already constructed of the self-approaching path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then let p be the last point added to the self-approaching path and let q be the point comming after p in the geodesic.<br>
      We compute tp, the tangent of CH at point p (Since 2 tangents are possible, the one chosen will depend of which chain p belong to).<br>
    </p>
    From here, we have 2 cases:
    <h4>case 1: The angle between tp and [pq] is no less than 90째</h4>
    <p>
      In this case, we just have to add the line segment [pq] to the self-approaching path since at each point of [pq] it is possible to "see" all of CH at once with a field of view of 90째.
    </p>
    <h4>case 2: The angle between tp and [pq] is less than 90째</h4>
