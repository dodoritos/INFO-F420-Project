    <h1>Self-Approaching Paths in Simple Polygons</h1>
    <h2>Romain Mardulyn, Dorian Hoet</h2>
    <p>A self approaching path between two points is a curve such that when you move along the curve the distance
    to any further point does not increase.</p>

    <h2>Important concepts</h2>
    <h3>Involute</h3>
    <p>An involute is a curve that depends on another curve. It's traced by unwrapping a string around the original curve</p>
    <p>For the Self-approaching path algorithm, we will only use involutes of circles, here you can see an example of such a curve</p>
    <p>You can slide to see the step of execution, or click on the canva to change the size and orientation of the circle.
      The involute is in red and the unwrapping string is in purple.</p>

    <input type="range" min="0" max="79" value="50" class="slider" id="stepSlider">
    <div id="involute"></div>
    <script src="involute_animation.js"></script>


    <p>Start: <span id="startSpan"></span>&pi;</p>
    <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="10" class="slider" id="startSlider">
    <p>End: <span id="endSpan"></span>&pi;</p>
    <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="20" class="slider" id="endSlider">
    <p>Rotation: <span id="rotationSpan"></span>&pi;</p>
    <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="20" class="slider" id="rotationSlider">
    <div id="involute_equation"></div>
    <script src="involute_equation.js"></script>

    <p>An involute is self aproaching.
      Indeed, the distance between the center of the circle and a point 'a' on the circle itself is fixed
      and the ditance between the involute curve and the tengent point is self aproaching,
      so the distance between the center and any point on the involute is always reducing.</p>

    <!--
    <h4>An equivalent definition of a self-approaching path is that for every point on the path
      there has to be a 90Â° angle containing the rest of the path.</h4>
    <p>or not...</p>
    <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="100" class="slider" id="angleSlider">

    <script src="involute_degree.js"></script>
    -->

    <h3>Involute curves of kth order </h3>
    <p>
      As said before, an involute is a curve defined by another curve. This other curve can be a circle,
      or an involute of a circle, which gives us an involute of an involute of a circle. An involute of second order.
    </p>

    <p>
      The involute of first order is in purple, and the involute of second order
      (involute of the involute of the circle) is in red
    </p>

      Tangent of involute.

    <h3>Geodesic path</h3>
    <p>
      A geodesic path is the shortest path composed of segments between two points in a polygon
    </p>
    <p>
      You can click on the canva to add points, then close the polygon and add two points inside it.
      The geodesic path will be displayed
    </p>

    <!--
    <h3>Given two points inside a simple polygon, does there exist a self-approaching path inside it?</h3>
    <h3>Find the shortest self-approaching path.</h3>
    <h3>Given a point s in a simple polygon P, what is the set of all points reach-able from s with self-approaching paths?</h3>
    <h3>Given a point t, what is the set of all points from which t is reachable with a self-approaching path?</h3>
    <h3>Given  a  polygonP,  test  if  it  is  self-approaching,  i.e.,  if  there  exists  aself-approaching path between any two points inP.</h3>
    -->

    <h2>Self approaching path</h2>
    <p>
      The self aproaching point is composed of lines, arcs and involutes. this algorith is not yet implemented
      but we have the tools we need to do so.
