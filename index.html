    <h2>Self-Approaching Paths in Simple Polygons</h2>
    <p>You will find several illustations of the conceps presented in the paper</p>

    <h3>Given two points inside a simple polygon, does there exist a self-approaching path inside it?</h3>

    <div id="canvas"></div>

    <h3>Find the shortest self-approaching path.</h3>
    <h3>Given a point s in a simple polygon P, what is the set of all points reach-able from s with self-approaching paths?</h3>
    <h3>Given a point t, what is the set of all points from which t is reachable with a self-approaching path?</h3>
    <h3>Given  a  polygonP,  test  if  it  is  self-approaching,  i.e.,  if  there  exists  aself-approaching path between any two points inP.</h3>
